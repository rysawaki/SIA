Subtitle: A Bio-Inspired Neural Architecture for Fluid Adaptation and Meta-Cognitive Control.

1. The Problem: Current AI is rigid. It suffers from catastrophic forgetting and slow adaptation.
2. The Solution: Instead of just updating weights, update the geometry of the self in real-time based on traces of experience.
3. Key Results:
• Phase Transition: Visualizing the moment of "trauma" and rapid adaptation.
• Memory Retrieval: Demonstrating A-B-A context switching without retraining.
